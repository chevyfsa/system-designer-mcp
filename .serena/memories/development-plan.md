# System Designer MCP Server - Complete Tool-Based Architecture

## Project Overview - REFACTORED

Building an MCP server that bridges AI agents with System Designer macOS application for UML diagram generation and system modeling. **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ARCHITECTURAL REFACTOR FROM PARSER-BASED TO TOOL-BASED APPROACH.**

## Key Architecture - TOOL-BASED

- **MCP Server**: Bridges AI agents â†” System Designer macOS app
- **Tool-Based Approach**: LLM uses our tools to create, validate, and export models
- **Integration**: File-based communication with Electron-based System Designer app
- **Runtime**: Bun JavaScript runtime with TypeScript

## Current File Structure

```
system-designer-mcp/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts              # Main MCP server entry point (TOOL-BASED)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tool-based.test.ts # Comprehensive test suite (10/10 PASSING)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Complete documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ PRD.md                    # Product Requirements Document (COMPLETED)

## COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### âœ… Phase 1-4: COMPLETE

- **MCP Server**: Fully functional with 4 core tools
- **Tool-Based Architecture**: Empowers LLM instead of replacing it
- **System Designer Integration**: File-based export functionality
- **Testing**: 10/10 passing tests with comprehensive coverage

### Core Tools Implemented

1. **create_mson_model**: Create MSON models with comprehensive validation
2. **validate_mson_model**: Validate existing MSON models against schema
3. **generate_uml_diagram**: Generate PlantUML and Mermaid diagrams
4. **export_to_system_designer**: Export models to System Designer format

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Zod Schemas**: Full validation for all MSON data types
- **Multiple Diagram Formats**: PlantUML and Mermaid generation
- **System Designer Export**: Direct export to macOS application format
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and error reporting
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation

## Architectural Success

**PARADIGM SHIFT COMPLETED**: From "trying to understand natural language ourselves" to "providing tools for the LLM to use"

### Previous Approach (REJECTED)

- Natural language parser with deterministic rules
- Complex pattern matching for entity extraction
- Limited to predefined domains (students, schools)
- Attempted to replace LLM intelligence

### New Approach (SUCCESSFUL)

- Clean, simple tools that empower the LLM
- LLM handles understanding requirements
- Tools provide validation, formatting, and export
- Works for ANY domain the LLM wants to model

## Benefits Achieved

- **Simplicity**: Much cleaner codebase without complex parsing logic
- **Flexibility**: Works for any domain, not just predefined ones
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and extend
- **Better LLM Integration**: Follows MCP best practices
- **Performance**: No complex parsing overhead
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools and features

## Integration Strategy - IMPLEMENTED

- **File-based**: Write MSON files to System Designer's data directory
- **JSON Format**: MSON models stored as structured JSON
- **Export Functionality**: Direct export to System Designer format
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for PlantUML and Mermaid diagrams

## Success Metrics - ACHIEVED âœ…

- âœ… MCP server functionality with all 4 core tools
- âœ… Successful integration patterns with System Designer macOS app
- âœ… Complete tool-based architecture
- âœ… Comprehensive testing (10/10 passing)
- âœ… Complete documentation
- âœ… Learning-focused approach resulting in functional MCP server

## Final Status: PROJECT COMPLETE ðŸŽ‰

The MCP server has been successfully refactored to a tool-based approach and is ready for use. All functionality is implemented, tested, and documented.
