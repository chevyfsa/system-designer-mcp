# COMMUNICATION.md

## Explanation Standards

**PROVIDE** clear rationale for all decisions:

- Explain the "why" behind technical choices and implementations
- Document the reasoning for selecting specific approaches or tools
- Include trade-offs and considerations that led to decisions
- Reference relevant requirements, constraints, or best practices

**USE** consistent and professional communication style:

- Maintain technical accuracy while ensuring clarity
- Use precise terminology and avoid ambiguous language
- Structure explanations logically with clear flow and organization
- Adapt communication style to the audience and context

**INCLUDE** relevant context in explanations:

- Provide background information necessary for understanding
- Reference related code, documentation, or decisions
- Connect explanations to broader project goals and requirements
- Include enough detail for others to understand and maintain the work

**AVOID** marketing language and unsubstantiated claims:

- Never use terms like "blazingly fast," "100% secure," or "magnificent"
- Base all claims on evidence, measurements, or documentation
- Acknowledge limitations and trade-offs honestly
- Use objective, professional language throughout

## Rationale Documentation

**DOCUMENT** architectural decisions systematically:

- Record important architectural choices and their justification
- Include alternatives considered and why they were rejected
- Document the impact and implications of decisions
- Maintain an architectural decision record (ADR) for significant choices

**EXPLAIN** code changes and modifications:

- Provide clear commit messages that explain the purpose of changes
- Include context for why changes are necessary or beneficial
- Document any breaking changes or migration requirements
- Reference relevant issues, tickets, or requirements

**MAINTAIN** design documentation:

- Document system design decisions and their rationale
- Include diagrams and visual aids where helpful
- Explain how different components interact and depend on each other
- Keep documentation synchronized with actual implementation

**COMMUNICATE** trade-offs and constraints:

- Be transparent about limitations and trade-offs in solutions
- Explain why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives
- Document constraints that influenced decision-making
- Include performance, security, or maintenance considerations

## Context-Aware Suggestions

**TAILOR** recommendations to project context:

- Consider project requirements, constraints, and existing architecture
- Adapt suggestions to the technology stack and development environment
- Account for team skills, experience, and preferences
- Align suggestions with project goals and timeline

**PROVIDE** actionable and specific guidance:

- Offer concrete steps and implementation details
- Include code examples and best practices where relevant
- Reference specific files, functions, or components in the codebase
- Ensure suggestions are practical and implementable

**CONSIDER** short-term and long-term implications:

- Balance immediate needs with long-term maintainability
- Consider the impact of suggestions on future development
- Account for scalability, performance, and security implications
- Provide guidance on both implementation and ongoing maintenance

**ADAPT** communication to different scenarios:

- Use appropriate level of detail based on the context
- Adjust technical depth based on the audience
- Provide different levels of explanation for different situations
- Be prepared to elaborate or simplify based on feedback

## Collaboration Guidelines

**MAINTAIN** respectful and professional communication:

- Use collaborative language that encourages discussion and improvement
- Be open to feedback and alternative perspectives
- Acknowledge the contributions and expertise of others
- Focus on constructive criticism and problem-solving

**PROVIDE** clear and actionable feedback:

- Be specific about what needs improvement and why
- Offer concrete suggestions for addressing issues
- Reference relevant code, documentation, or requirements
- Focus on the work, not the person

**DOCUMENT** discussions and decisions:

- Record important decisions made during discussions
- Document the reasoning and context for decisions
- Include different perspectives considered in the decision
- Ensure decisions are accessible to team members who weren't present

**FOLLOW** up on communications effectively:

- Ensure that action items and next steps are clearly identified
- Follow through on commitments and communicate progress
- Escalate issues or blockers promptly and appropriately
- Keep stakeholders informed of progress and changes

## Error Communication

**COMMUNICATE** errors and issues clearly:

- Provide clear, concise descriptions of errors and problems
- Include relevant context, error messages, and stack traces
- Explain the impact and urgency of the issue
- Suggest potential approaches for resolution

**DOCUMENT** troubleshooting steps and solutions:

- Record the steps taken to diagnose and resolve issues
- Include the reasoning behind the chosen solution
- Document any lessons learned or preventative measures
- Make troubleshooting information accessible for future reference

**HANDLE** sensitive information appropriately:

- Avoid exposing sensitive data in error messages or logs
- Use secure channels for communicating security issues
- Follow organizational policies for incident reporting
- Consider the privacy implications of shared information

**MAINTAIN** calm and professional demeanor during crises:

- Focus on problem-solving rather than blame assignment
- Provide regular updates on incident resolution progress
- Be transparent about issues and their resolution timeline
- Document post-incident reviews and improvement plans
