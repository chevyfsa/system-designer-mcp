- examples/banking-system-runtime-bundle.json (556 lines)
- examples/PROMPTS.md (natural language prompts)
- examples/VERIFICATION.md (authenticity verification)
- EXAMPLES_SUMMARY.md (project summary)

Files Updated:
- examples/README.md: Comprehensive documentation (479 lines)
- scripts/generate-examples.ts: Generate all 5 output formats
- All example outputs regenerated with authentic tool outputs

Quality Assurance:
- All examples validated with validate_mson_model
- All bundles validated with validate_system_runtime_bundle
- All 46 tests passing
- 100% reproducible via generation script

This ensures all examples are authentic MCP server outputs suitable for
documentation, education, and LLM training data.
